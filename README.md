# Prediction-Real-Estates-Prices-in-Riyadh
To meet its goal of increasing Saudi citizen homeownership to 70% by 2030, the Saudi Ministry of Housing announced a proposal to build about 19,500 housing units under the "sakani" housing development program. The Ministry of Housing, in collaboration with the Real Estate Development Fund, initiated several programs to help residents get housing, and the Kingdom even implemented a rental price index to improve transparency and control in the residential real estate market.
Furthermore, due to the appearance of numerous advertisements on the websites of real estate apps such as (Haraj, Sohail, Aqar, and others), we discover that real estate prices have risen in various Riyadh areas.
